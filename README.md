- ⚡ Working (and having a blast) with the CRM Filters FE team at HubSpot!
- 🤝 Engineering Manager at <a href="https://bitsofgood.org/" target="_blank">Bits of Good</a>, Georgia Tech's Hack4Impact chapter building software for non-profits in Atlanta and beyond.
- 🤔 I genuinely find it difficult stick to just frontend, backend or algorithmic devlopment cycles, and hence am an aspiring full-stack SWE.
- 🔭 I’m currently...
    - Experimenting with a few machine learning models and their potential applications in quantitative analysis. 
    - Working on updating my (super) outdated <a href="https://palathingal.xyz" target="_blank">website</a>.
    - Finishing up on a project using UFC fight statistics to assist in matchmaking and prevent injuries due to unfair matchmaking.
